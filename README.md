# godot incremental patching (WIP)

![Live loading a PCK file](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38859656/102728162-25e4b400-42f8-11eb-9265-a3a93e32aab1.gif)

So far we are only demonstrating the live loading of a PCK file.  A more complete example of incremental patching will hopefully be delivered soon.  

You can read the planning ticket in #2.

[See the official docs](https://godot-es-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/workflow/export/exporting_pcks.html) for more information on Godot Engine's support for live-reloading of PCK (game payload) files.
